# Placeholder Images

This directory contains placeholder images used throughout the portfolio site.

## How to Replace Placeholders

1. **Headshot**: Replace `headshot.jpg` with your professional headshot photo
   - Recommended size: 800x800px minimum
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Keep the filename as `headshot.jpg`

2. **Project Images**: Navigate to `/public/images/projects/[project-slug]/` and replace:
   - `hero.jpg` - Main project hero image (recommended: 1600x900px)
   - Add additional images as needed: `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, etc.

## Current Placeholders

- `headshot.jpg` - Your profile/headshot image
- Project hero images in `/public/images/projects/*/hero.jpg`

All placeholders are currently SVG files saved with .jpg extensions for compatibility. Simply replace them with actual JPG/PNG images of the same filename.
