## What I do

I help organizations navigate complexity and uncover the right problems to solve. With over a decade of experience across government, finance, healthcare, and tech, I lead cross-functional teams from hypothesis to validated outcomes.

My work centers on:

- **Early-stage discovery and experimentation** — forming hypotheses, designing lean tests, and guiding teams toward evidence-based decisions
- **Strategic product leadership** — defining vision, positioning, and roadmaps that balance user needs with commercial impact
- **AI strategy & adoption** — prototyping AI-powered concepts, assessing feasibility, and helping teams adopt faster, AI-enabled ways of working

I partner with C-suite stakeholders to translate complex organizational challenges into clear, actionable direction and validated strategic outcomes.
