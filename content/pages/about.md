## Background

I'm a product strategist and design leader with over 10 years of experience shaping digital platforms, services, and product portfolios across finance, government, healthcare, and tech.

My focus is on navigating ambiguity, uncovering the right problems, and translating complex organizational challenges into clear, insight-led direction and validated strategic outcomes.

## Approach

Deeply experienced in early-stage discovery and experimentation, I form hypotheses, design lean tests, and guide cross-functional teams toward evidence-based decisions. AI-fluent and hands-on, I use emerging tools daily to accelerate concept development, generate artifacts, and support early-stage thinking.

I've led the introduction of design practice and service design culture across large organizations, involving strategic planning, roadmapping, and advocacy for early, end-to-end experience design engagements.
