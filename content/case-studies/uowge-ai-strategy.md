## Overview

UOW Global Enterprises (UOWGE) operates as the commercial arm of the University of Wollongong, delivering higher education experiences to international students across a network of global campuses.

Like many institutions navigating the current wave of AI capability, UOWGE recognised the potential for AI to meaningfully improve how students discover, apply, enrol, and ultimately succeed in their studies. The challenge wasn't a shortage of enthusiasm — it was knowing where to focus, and how to frame the opportunity in a way that was grounded in real student needs rather than technology for its own sake.

UOWGE engaged Pollen to lead an AI strategy engagement: facilitating a structured, human-centred workshop to surface genuine pain points across the student journey, generate AI-driven ideas from across the organisation, and help leadership prioritise where to act first.

**My responsibilities:** AI strategy • Workshop design & facilitation • Pain point synthesis • Opportunity framing & prioritisation

## Framing the approach

Before any ideation could begin, the engagement needed a clear frame.

For UOWGE, the student population is primarily international — arriving from diverse countries, navigating unfamiliar education systems, managing language barriers, and making high-stakes decisions with their families. This context meant AI couldn't simply be positioned as a productivity tool or a cost-saving measure. The real question was: where can AI help students feel more supported, more confident, and more connected throughout one of the most significant transitions of their lives?

With that framing established, the work was structured around a single session with 20 stakeholders from across the organisation — spanning recruitment, admissions, student services, academic advisory, digital, and operations teams. Bringing this range of perspectives into the room was deliberate: student experience challenges rarely belong to a single team, and the opportunities to address them rarely do either.

## Running the workshop

The session was designed to move quickly, with a clear sequence of activities to keep participants grounded in student reality before opening up to possibility.

We began with a student journey walkthrough, mapping the experience from initial awareness through to life after graduation. Working across five stages — Awareness, Consideration, Commit & Apply, Accept & Enrol, Study, and Post Study — participants identified the friction points, confusion, and unmet needs they observed or heard most frequently. Pain points were mapped at both the student experience level and the operational back-of-house level, surfacing both the visible and invisible challenges UOWGE was navigating.

More than 100 individual pain points were captured across the journey. These consolidated into 11 recurring themes: general knowledge gaps, academic alignment challenges, language barriers, lack of student confidence, unclear physical and location information, pricing transparency, inefficient application processes, difficulty accessing support, isolation and community concerns, workforce readiness, and fragmented agent support.

What stood out was how consistently these problems showed up across the room — teams that rarely overlapped in their day-to-day work were describing the same student struggles from different vantage points. That alignment was itself a valuable output of the session.

From there, the session shifted into AI-driven ideation — generating ideas for how AI could address those pain points in meaningful, student-centred ways. Participants were encouraged to think beyond current constraints and focus on genuine value: what would actually help a student feel confident and supported, and where does that also create commercial upside for UOWGE?

With ideas on the table, the group worked through a rapid prioritisation exercise, mapping opportunities against both student impact and commercial value — helping the organisation move from a broad landscape of possibility to a focused, defensible set of directions.

## What emerged

The prioritisation conversation surfaced a clear consensus around where AI could have the greatest near-term impact: the onboarding phase — specifically the transition from offer acceptance through to arriving on campus and beginning study.

This is a moment of significant anxiety for international students. The questions they have during this window — What happens next? What do I need to prepare? Will I be okay? — often go unanswered until they're already overwhelmed. The group agreed that a personalised, AI-enabled onboarding experience had the potential to dramatically improve student confidence, reduce drop-off between offer and enrolment, and ease the administrative burden on support staff.

Four broader opportunity areas were defined as potential pilot directions:

**Helping students find the right path, faster** — AI-powered discovery at the awareness stage, helping prospective students and families understand course options, career outcomes, and costs with personalised, data-driven guidance.

**Smoother transitions from offer to arrival** — the top-ranked priority from the session, an AI-enabled onboarding experience that guides students through the critical weeks between accepting an offer and starting study, building confidence and reducing confusion before they arrive.

**Your campus companion** — an always-on AI assistant to support students during study, improving access to services, academic guidance, and wellbeing resources without placing additional load on frontline staff.

**Smarter systems, smarter decisions** — AI-enhanced tools for agents and internal teams, surfacing insights from CRM and inquiry data, streamlining application processing, and improving consistency across the recruitment ecosystem.

Underpinning all four was a strong appetite for multilingual AI capability — the ability to translate not just language, but meaning, for students navigating complex information in a second language.

## The outcome

The engagement shifted the conversation from "what can we build?" to "where should we focus, and why?" — which is exactly the right question to be asking before committing to delivery.

UOWGE left with a clear set of outputs: onboarding (offer to enrolment) identified as the highest-impact starting point; recognition that early-funnel AI support carries strong acquisition upside; alignment that translation and analytics should underpin any future solution rather than be treated as standalone features; and a shared language for AI that moved beyond "chatbots" — reframed as an ecosystem of experiences across the student journey.

Equally important was the clarity on sequencing. The recommended path forward framed the next step as vision and strategy before delivery — ensuring investment decisions would be shaped by a shared picture of the future, not made in isolation by individual teams.

For an organisation moving quickly in a complex space, leaving with alignment is as valuable as leaving with a plan. Getting twenty stakeholders — across recruitment, admissions, digital, and operations — to land on a shared view of where AI creates the most value is not a small thing. That clarity is what makes the work that follows worth doing.
