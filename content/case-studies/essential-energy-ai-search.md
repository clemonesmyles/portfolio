## Overview

Essential Energy delivers electricity to regional and rural communities across New South Wales, supporting households, businesses, and essential services across a vast and geographically dispersed network.

For customers and communities, the website is a primary source of information — from planned outages and connections through to safety guidance, defects, and emergency updates. People often arrive with a specific question and an expectation of quick, clear answers, sometimes during stressful or time-critical situations.

Despite holding a large amount of useful information, Essential Energy faced ongoing challenges with discoverability. Customers regularly reported difficulty finding what they needed, navigating dense content structures, or understanding which information applied to their situation.

**My responsibilities:** Product strategy • Human-centred AI (HCD AI) • Product definition • Workshop facilitation • UX writing & design

## Framing the problem

This work did not start from a blank slate.

The opportunity to improve search and information access was informed by deep discovery conducted during an earlier website strategy engagement for Essential Energy, which I led. That work involved extensive research into customer needs, behaviours, and pain points, as well as a detailed understanding of the organisation’s content, systems, and constraints.

One theme consistently emerged: people weren’t struggling because information didn’t exist — they were struggling to find it quickly, interpret it confidently, and know what to do next.

Traditional keyword-based search often failed when users didn’t know the right terminology or how information was structured. This resulted in repeated searching, unnecessary navigation, and frustration, even when the answer already existed somewhere on the site.

The opportunity was to complement existing search with an AI-enabled experience that could help people orient themselves faster and more effectively, without disrupting established content models or navigation patterns.

## Approach

I led product strategy and experience design across discovery, definition, and delivery, working closely with Essential Energy stakeholders across digital, content, and technology teams, alongside engineers responsible for implementation and integration.

Building on insights from the earlier website strategy work, the focus was on addressing real, recurring problems rather than speculative use cases. Common questions, complaints, and search behaviours were analysed to understand where existing experiences broke down and where AI could add practical value.

AI was explored as a way to interpret intent, connect people to relevant information, and summarise complex guidance in plain language — while always anchoring responses to approved source content. Rather than positioning AI as a replacement for search, it was designed to sit alongside and enhance existing navigation and discovery patterns.

Close collaboration with engineers ensured the solution could be safely integrated into the live site, aligned with existing systems, and governed appropriately.

## The solution

The outcome is a live, AI-powered search and Q&A experience embedded directly within the Essential Energy website.

Customers can ask questions in natural language and receive clear, concise responses grounded in Essential Energy’s approved content. Answers are designed to be scannable and practical, helping users quickly understand what applies to them and where to go next.

The AI experience complements traditional search rather than replacing it, offering an alternative pathway for people who prefer to ask questions rather than browse or guess keywords.

Observability is built into the solution, allowing teams to see what people are asking, how information is being used, and where gaps or confusion remain. This creates an ongoing feedback loop to improve both the AI experience and the underlying content over time.

## Conclusion

This project shows how human-centred AI can be applied in a practical, real-world context — helping people find critical information more easily, especially when time and clarity matter.

This work provided Essential Energy with a pragmatic, production-ready example of how AI can improve public-facing information access without introducing risk or unnecessary complexity. It helped address long-standing discoverability issues, reduced friction for customers trying to find answers quickly, and built directly on insights from earlier strategic work to deliver tangible improvements.

Early results show positive impact based on baseline website metrics, with good feedback both internally and externally on the tool's effectiveness and value. More broadly, it demonstrated how AI can be layered into existing digital foundations — enhancing them rather than overhauling them.

It reflects my approach to AI-enabled product strategy: leveraging deep organisational understanding, grounding decisions in real user behaviour, collaborating closely with engineering, and designing solutions that integrate cleanly into existing systems while delivering meaningful improvement.
