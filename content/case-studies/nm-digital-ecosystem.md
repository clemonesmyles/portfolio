## Overview

Northwestern Mutual's digital platform, NM Connect, had evolved over more than a decade. What began as a centralised tool for advisors had grown into a sprawling ecosystem of disconnected applications, one-off builds, and legacy systems — each serving a specific function but none working together cohesively.

The enterprise experience design team was tasked with creating a vision for a single, interconnected platform. This wasn't about incremental improvements. It was about stepping back to define what the entire digital experience could look like if designed intentionally — grounded in research, aligned to business objectives, and capable of serving advisors, clients, and home office staff through every stage of their journey.

I led the design strategy and service design work that shaped this vision, partnering with design leadership, product teams, and business stakeholders to translate organisational complexity into a clear, actionable direction.

## The challenge

> "Nearly all pain points across home office, field, and client experience point directly towards antiquated technology and legacy systems."

NM Connect had been built in the late 2000s. Over time, it had accumulated tools and features without governance, cohesive structure, or a unifying design system. Advisors navigated dozens of disconnected applications to complete core tasks. New hires faced steep learning curves. Clients experienced fragmented touchpoints that didn't reflect the quality of advice they received in person.

The platform needed to be restructured as the single destination for all business users — spanning financial planning, insurance sales, servicing, wealth management, investing, client management, and training. But before any of that could happen, the organisation needed a shared picture of what "good" looked like.

## Aligning on objectives

The vision work began with alignment. Before designing anything, we needed to understand what the organisation was trying to achieve and ensure the vision would ladder up to real business priorities.

I facilitated a series of workshops with design leadership and cross-functional partners, bringing together representatives from Planning, Products & Servicing, Platforms, Career Distribution, Design Systems, and Content teams. Each group brought different objectives, constraints, and priorities.

Through co-creation activities, we mapped business objectives across portfolios, identified high-impact scenarios, and voted on priorities that the vision should address. This wasn't about consensus for its own sake — it was about surfacing the tensions and trade-offs that any credible vision would need to navigate.

## From pain points to scenarios

With objectives aligned, we shifted focus to the people the platform would serve. Working from existing research — including North Star pain points, field feedback, and client insights — we developed scenarios that captured real moments of friction and opportunity.

These scenarios spanned the full lifecycle: a new advisor joining the organisation, a client beginning their financial planning journey, a home office specialist supporting complex cases. Each scenario became a lens for exploring how the platform could better serve its users.

We also reviewed previous vision work across Mobile, Learning, Planning, Business, and News — capturing what had worked, what hadn't, and what principles should carry forward. This grounded the new vision in institutional knowledge rather than starting from scratch.

## Mapping the journey

The centrepiece of the vision work was a comprehensive journey map that traced the experience across all three audiences — Field (advisors), Clients, and Home Office staff — showing how their paths intersected and where the platform could create connection rather than friction.

This "bookend" narrative followed key moments: an advisor's first day, a client's introduction to Northwestern Mutual, the ongoing relationship as it deepened over time. For each moment, we mapped the narrative summary, the journey stage, the experience for each audience, strategic themes being addressed, platform features required, and conceptual screens to support the story.

The journey map became a reference point for the entire organisation — a way to see how individual initiatives connected to a larger whole.

## Developing the scenarios

From the journey map, we developed detailed scenario storyboards that brought the vision to life. Each scenario followed a specific persona through a sequence of moments, showing how the platform would support them at each step.

The "Advisor Path" scenario (2022) followed Britt, a new financial representative, from her first day through onboarding, learning, community engagement, and early success. The "Hello, Welcome to NM" scenario (2023) followed Jeff and Susie, prospective clients, from their first digital touchpoint through finding an advisor and beginning their financial planning journey.

These scenarios weren't just illustrations — they were tools for alignment, helping product teams, engineers, and business stakeholders understand what we were building toward and why.

## Bringing the vision to life

The vision culminated in a series of conceptual designs illustrating key moments across the platform — from advisor matching and onboarding, through learning and community engagement, to celebrating achievements.

## Conclusion

> "A good product vision serves as the north star for the product organisation so that we have a common understanding of what we are hoping to accomplish together."

This work gave Northwestern Mutual a clear, shared picture of what its digital ecosystem could become. It aligned stakeholders around a common direction, provided product teams with scenarios they could build toward, and established design patterns that would scale across the platform.

Most importantly, it reframed the conversation from features and systems to people and experiences. The vision wasn't about technology — it was about creating the conditions for advisors to thrive, clients to feel supported, and the organisation to deliver on its promise of financial security.
