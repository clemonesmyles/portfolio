## Overview

Gated Legacy began with an ambitious idea shaped by the founders' own experiences: helping people better manage, organise, and pass on important personal information across major life events.

The space was inherently complex. It touched personal data, legal considerations, emotional decision-making, and long-term trust. While the idea resonated intuitively, it was unclear where the real value sat, who the product was truly for, and what it would take to build something both viable and defensible.

I led a small, multidisciplinary team to work alongside the two founders, with a clear goal: bring structure, rigor, and evidence to an idea that was still very much at a "back of the napkin" stage.

**My responsibilities:** Product strategy • Product discovery • Business design • Research leadership • Workshop facilitation

## Starting with uncertainty — deliberately

This work was designed to begin with uncertainty, not rush past it.

Rather than moving straight into solution mode, we created space to slow down and ask harder questions. The aim was not to validate a pre-formed idea, but to understand the problem space deeply enough to make a confident call about whether there was something worth pursuing.

Working closely with the founders, I shaped and facilitated a structured discovery process that balanced open exploration with discipline. From the outset, we aligned on the idea that a meaningful outcome could just as easily be a decision *not* to proceed — provided that decision was grounded in evidence and shared understanding.

## Exploring the landscape to build conviction

We began by broadening the lens.

The team mapped the wider ecosystem around life events, legacy planning, and personal data — identifying stakeholders, adjacent solutions, and moments of friction where unmet needs might exist. This helped move the conversation beyond a single idea and toward a clear understanding of the system we were entering.

Alongside this, I led value proposition work to explore how the product might create real value. Different audiences, entry points, and propositions were articulated and pressure-tested, helping surface early signals around motivation, trust, and willingness to engage.

This phase wasn't about committing to a direction — it was about building conviction around where *not* to focus.

## Researching for stronger signals

To ground strategic thinking in reality, I framed and led a mixed-method research program with my peers.

This combined qualitative interviews with quantitative inputs to test early hypotheses around behaviour, intent, and effort. The research helped distinguish between what people said they wanted and what they were realistically willing to do — particularly when it came to ongoing engagement, maintenance of information, and emotionally difficult decisions.

These signals were critical in shifting conversations from intuition to evidence, and in challenging assumptions that initially felt compelling but didn't hold up under scrutiny.

## Shaping and testing ideas to surface trade-offs

As patterns emerged, we moved into concept exploration — not to design a finished product, but to make assumptions tangible.

UX and concept design were used as tools for thinking. Scenarios, flows, and early concepts helped the team explore how the idea might work in practice, where it could break down, and what kinds of effort it would demand from users and the business.

While I wasn't hands-on in producing the designs, I steered the work closely to ensure concepts reflected discovery insights and the realities we were uncovering. These explorations surfaced important trade-offs, particularly around long-term engagement, data accuracy, and trust.

They revealed how quickly the product could become burdensome — both for users expected to keep information up to date, and for a business responsible for supporting it responsibly.

## Synthesis into decision-making

As discovery progressed, the work increasingly focused on synthesis and decision-making.

Insights from research, value proposition work, and concept exploration were brought together and assessed through multiple lenses: user value, behavioural likelihood, operational complexity, and long-term sustainability.

This created the conditions for open, grounded conversations with the founders about risk, scope, and ambition. Rather than defaulting to momentum, the team was able to step back and make an informed decision about whether to proceed, pivot, or pause.

## Why this work mattered

Although the product did not move into build, the work delivered clarity at a critical moment.

The founders gained a much deeper understanding of the space they were exploring, the real complexity involved, and the implications of taking the idea forward. The process reduced uncertainty, avoided premature investment, and replaced assumptions with shared, evidence-based understanding.

It also created a strong foundation the founders could return to — whether to revisit the idea later, explore adjacent opportunities, or apply the same rigor to future ventures.

## Conclusion

This project shows the breadth of my work in early-stage contexts — partnering with founders from the earliest spark of an idea, often shaped by personal experience, and applying structure, research, and strategy to bring clarity.

Sometimes that clarity leads to building. Other times, it leads to stopping or reshaping the idea entirely. In both cases, the value lies in making better decisions earlier, before momentum turns into commitment.
