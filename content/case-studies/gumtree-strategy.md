## Context

Gumtree, one of Australia's leading classifieds platforms, recognized the need to evolve beyond simple listings toward a more transactional model. They needed a clear, evidence-based strategy to guide this transformation and increase platform vibrancy.

## Problem

The platform faced declining engagement and needed to understand:
- How to leverage their unique position in the market
- What would drive increased transaction volume and user activity
- How to balance marketplace dynamics with user trust and safety
- What strategic moves would deliver both user and business value

## Approach

I led a small multi-disciplinary team through a comprehensive strategic discovery process:

- **Three-lens analysis**: Examined the opportunity through business, audience, and market trend perspectives
- **Stakeholder collaboration**: Worked closely with Gumtree's leadership team to develop a cogent narrative supported by facts and research
- **Strategic narrative development**: Created a clear articulation of how Gumtree could leverage its unique selling proposition and provide differentiated value to customers
- **Concept visualization**: Designed concept work to bring the strategy to life and make it tangible for product leadership
- **Implementation planning**: Developed actionable recommendations and a strategic plan for moving forward

## Outcomes

- Delivered a comprehensive strategy grounded in business insight, user research, and market trends
- Equipped product leadership with clear direction and tactical next steps
- Created compelling concept designs that visualized the strategic direction
- Provided a framework for decision-making as the organization moved toward transactional capabilities
- Aligned cross-functional teams around a shared vision for the platform's future
