## Overview

Arthritis NSW supports people living with arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions across New South Wales and beyond. Arthritis is a chronic, lifelong condition affecting millions of Australians, yet no two experiences are the same. Symptoms fluctuate, conditions vary widely, and people often need different types of support at different stages of their journey.

While Arthritis NSW had a strong foundation of trusted information, programs, and services, people often struggled to find what was most relevant to them in the moment. Content could feel overwhelming, generic, or difficult to translate into day-to-day action — particularly for people managing pain, fatigue, or emotional strain.

Arthritis NSW saw an opportunity to create a more personalised, supportive digital experience that could grow with people over time, helping them better understand and manage their condition while staying grounded in credible, evidence-based guidance.

**My responsibilities:** Product strategy • Human-centred AI (HCD AI) • Product definition • Workshop facilitation • UX writing & design

## Framing the challenge

Managing arthritis is not about finding a single answer. It's an ongoing process of learning, adapting, and making decisions in response to changing symptoms and circumstances.

The challenge was to design a platform that could meet people where they were — offering reassurance and clarity without medicalising the experience or overwhelming users with information. Any use of AI needed to be explainable, trustworthy, and supportive, particularly in a health context where confidence and accuracy matter deeply.

Alongside this, there was a broader organisational challenge: how could a digital platform support Arthritis NSW's mission in a way that was scalable, sustainable, and commercially responsible?

## Strategy, alignment, and approval

I led the product strategy work that shaped the platform from an early concept into a board-approved initiative.

This included defining the product vision, scope, and value proposition, and authoring the documentation used to secure executive and board endorsement. The work balanced user needs, organisational capability, risk, and long-term sustainability — ensuring the platform was not only desirable, but viable and aligned to Arthritis NSW's purpose.

In parallel, I worked with stakeholders to explore acquisition and monetisation strategies that could support long-term impact. Rather than treating the platform as a standalone digital product, it was positioned as part of a broader ecosystem — supporting reach, engagement, and future revenue opportunities without compromising trust or accessibility.

## Approach

With strategic alignment in place, I led product strategy and experience design across discovery, definition, and delivery, working closely with Arthritis NSW stakeholders, clinicians, content specialists, and engineers.

The work began with deep exploration of how people live with arthritis day to day — how they seek information, what questions arise at different moments, and where existing tools fell short. This informed a clear product direction focused on long-term support rather than one-off interactions.

AI was positioned as an enabling layer, not the headline feature. Large language models (LLMs) were explored as a way to help people navigate complex information more naturally, while remaining firmly grounded in trusted content. Clear boundaries were defined to ensure responses were evidence-based, appropriately framed, and aligned to Arthritis NSW's role as a support organisation rather than a clinical authority.

Close collaboration with engineers shaped both the technical architecture and the experience itself. The platform integrates with a headless CMS (Sanity), enabling structured, curated content to evolve over time, with AI capabilities layered on top to support personalisation, discovery, and natural language interaction.

## The solution

The outcome was **Clara** — a digital platform designed to empower people living with arthritis through personalised, AI-enabled support.

Clara includes both a web platform and a native iOS app, which are live and actively used, with more than 15,000 downloads to date. At its core is an AI-powered engine built on LLM technology, trained on a curated body of Arthritis NSW content alongside trusted third-party sources.

People can ask questions in plain language and receive clear, structured responses tailored to their condition, interests, and stage of management. Beyond Q&A, the platform supports ongoing engagement through personalised content, educational resources, events, and tools designed to help people build understanding and confidence over time.

The experience is deliberately calm and human in tone. Rather than leaning into conversational novelty, it prioritises clarity, reassurance, and credibility — helping people feel supported without overstating certainty or offering false promises.

## Engagement and evolution

Clara was designed as a living product, not a one-off release.

Beyond launch, I've continued to work closely with Arthritis NSW on product shaping and engagement strategy, including notification planning, lifecycle design, and prioritisation of new capabilities. This work focuses on helping people return to the platform at meaningful moments, reinforcing learning, and supporting healthier behaviours over time.

Alongside this, we developed a long-term product roadmap outlining how the platform will continue to evolve — expanding its capabilities, deepening personalisation, and introducing new forms of support as user needs and organisational priorities change. The roadmap provides a clear line of sight between near-term delivery and longer-term ambition.

## Impact

Clara has given Arthritis NSW a scalable digital foundation to better support people living with arthritis — combining trusted content, human-centred AI, and thoughtful product design.

It has improved access to relevant, credible information, enabled more personalised support at scale, and created new pathways for engagement, acquisition, and long-term value. Just as importantly, it has equipped the organisation with the strategic clarity and confidence to continue investing in digital capability responsibly.

This project demonstrates how AI can be applied thoughtfully in a health context — not as a replacement for clinical care, but as a supportive layer that helps people make sense of complex information and feel more in control of their condition.

It reflects my role as a product strategy lead working at the intersection of human-centred design, AI, and delivery — shaping vision, securing alignment, collaborating closely with engineering, and building platforms designed to evolve with care and intent.
