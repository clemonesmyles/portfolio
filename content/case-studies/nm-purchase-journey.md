## Overview

At Northwestern Mutual, the purchase journey — from initial application through policy delivery and onboarding — touched nearly every part of the organisation. Hundreds of agents, specialists, representatives, and clients each played a role, navigating a complex web of systems, workflows, and handoffs.

While components of the journey were already in production or recently launched, no holistic view existed. Teams understood their piece of the process, but not how it connected to the whole. Advisors relied on personal workarounds. Clients were often left in the dark. And the organisation lacked a shared understanding of what a coherent, end-to-end purchase experience could look like.

I led the exploration into redefining Northwestern Mutual's purchase journey — creating the strategic artefacts and conceptual designs needed to align the organisation around a long-term vision and translate that vision into actionable design direction.

## The scale of the problem

This was not a UX challenge in the traditional sense. It was a system-level problem rooted in organisational complexity, technical debt, and years of incremental growth.

The numbers told the story clearly: around 80% of applications required rework before completion. Average cycle times stretched to 30 days. Advisors and home office staff navigated over 90 systems to complete core tasks. Nearly half of all labour was estimated to be spent on non-value-adding activities — chasing updates, re-entering data, and managing workarounds.

For clients, the experience felt fragmented and opaque. Communication was inconsistent. Application status was unclear. Payment methods were outdated. And onboarding often felt like an afterthought rather than a moment of celebration.

For the organisation, this fragmentation represented significant cost, lost efficiency, and risk. It also constrained the ability to deliver on the promise of a modern, advisor-centred digital platform.

## Creating alignment through service design

Creating a cohesive purchase experience required more than design. It required buy-in.

The company was in the midst of defining strategic objectives, which meant this work needed to clearly illustrate pain points, dependencies, and opportunities — and ladder up to broader business priorities. I partnered closely with the data strategy team, who were running multi-year planning in parallel, to ensure alignment between experience direction and underlying platform investments.

A series of co-creation workshops brought together leaders from across the organisation — product, operations, technology, field leadership — to collaboratively map the current state and envision the future. These sessions created shared ownership and helped surface insights that would have been invisible from within any single silo.

## Making the future tangible

The centrepiece of the work was a future-state service blueprint that spanned the full purchase journey — from initial client conversation through policy delivery and beyond.

The blueprint served multiple purposes. It visualised previously intangible experiences, making visible the interconnections and dependencies between service, technology, and operations. It aligned perspectives by providing a cross-silo view that no single team could have produced alone. And it created a foundation for prototyping — helping teams understand design implications and identify high-value moments to explore further.

From the blueprint, I identified key experience moments and developed conceptual designs that showed how a more unified platform could work in practice. These weren't speculative visions — they built on existing design system components and platform capabilities, demonstrating how current investments could be extended and connected.

## Bringing the vision to life

High-value moments from the blueprint became jumping-off points for detailed experience design. Each concept was supported by click-down documentation that captured the problem being solved, the intended value exchange, how the experience would be used, and potential success metrics.

**Unified application tracker.** An interconnected view of application status for home office staff, advisors, and clients. Previously, tracking happened across legacy applications, spreadsheets, and whiteboards — with no consistent view across parties. The new tracker centralised status, timeline, and next steps, ensuring everyone knew where things stood. Early concepts also explored how messaging between parties could be integrated directly into the workflow.

**Just-in-time milestone delivery.** Empowering advisors to deliver important news — like policy approval — directly and digitally, rather than having clients learn about milestones through delayed or impersonal channels. This ensured advisors remained at the centre of the client relationship during key moments.

**Consistent product experience.** A unified view of insurance and investment products within a single platform, reducing the learning curve for advisors and providing clients with transparency across all their products and applications — whether at an individual or household level.

## Projected impact

The business case for transforming the purchase journey was significant. Connecting the purchase experience to the digital platform was projected to reduce operating costs and dramatically improve processing times. Moving from paper-based, manual workflows to end-to-end digital processes was expected to increase both accelerated and automated business volume substantially.

In specific areas like medical information and examination workflows, the combination of mobile integration, vendor connectivity, and improved transparency was projected to reduce policy timelines, free up advisor administrative time, and decrease inbound call volume to the home office.

These projections helped secure executive alignment and informed prioritisation across the multi-year transformation roadmap.

## Conclusion

The work to redefine Northwestern Mutual's purchase journey operated at the intersection of strategy, service design, and organisational change.

It helped the organisation see a fragmented, complex system as a coherent whole — and provided a clear, shared vision of what a modern purchase experience could look like. Service blueprints, conceptual designs, and detailed experience documentation gave teams at every level a common reference point for planning, prioritisation, and execution.

Most importantly, it demonstrated that improving the purchase journey wasn't just about better UX. It was about creating the conditions for the business to operate more efficiently, advisors to focus on what matters most, and clients to feel confident and informed throughout one of the most important financial decisions of their lives.
