## Overview

At Northwestern Mutual, thousands of financial advisors rely on digital tools every day to support millions of client relationships across insurance, investment, and wealth management products.

Over time, the organisation's digital ecosystem had grown organically. Advisors were working across hundreds of disconnected tools, platforms, and workflows — often re-entering information, switching contexts, and relying on personal workarounds just to complete core tasks. What existed was functional, but fragmented. What was missing was coherence.

Northwestern Mutual recognised that incremental improvements were no longer enough. To support advisors effectively — and modernise the business — the organisation needed a shared, enterprise-wide vision for how its platforms, services, and experiences should work together.

## The scale of the problem

This was not a traditional UX challenge. It was a system-level issue.

Advisors routinely moved between dozens of applications to onboard clients, manage policies, deliver advice, and service ongoing needs. Back-office teams faced similar fragmentation, supported by legacy systems that constrained efficiency and slowed change. Across the organisation, teams were investing heavily in digital, but often in isolation.

The result was duplicated effort, increasing technical debt, inconsistent experiences, and growing cognitive load for advisors whose primary focus should have been their clients.

What the organisation lacked was not delivery capability, but a clear, shared picture of the future that teams could align around.

## Making complexity visible

A critical part of the work was helping the organisation see the problem clearly.

We mapped the full ecosystem of tools, services, and advisor workflows, making visible the scale and complexity advisors were navigating every day. Artefacts such as journey maps, service blueprints, and future-state scenarios translated abstract challenges into something tangible and shared.

## Defining a grounded North Star

I led the experience strategy and service design work to define the **Advisor Vision** — a unifying view of how advisors and internal teams should experience Northwestern Mutual's digital ecosystem in the future.

This work needed to operate at multiple levels. Strategically, it had to align with broader business priorities, platform modernisation efforts, and long-term organisational goals. Practically, it had to reflect the realities of existing systems, workflows, and constraints.

Working closely with senior leaders, product owners, designers, and technologists, we stepped back from individual initiatives to examine the system as a whole. Through research, interviews, and facilitated workshops, we surfaced common pain points, dependencies, and moments of friction that cut across products and functions.

The result was a North Star that was ambitious, but grounded — clear enough to drive change, and realistic enough to act on.

## Design and experience principles

Experience principles and detailed design work brought the vision to life, translating strategic direction into tangible patterns and interactions that teams could understand and apply.

## Bringing the vision to life

Conceptual designs showed what a more unified, interconnected platform could look like in practice while acknowledging the constraints of existing technology and organisational structure.

These artefacts became common reference points — used by teams to discuss trade-offs, priorities, and long-term direction.

## From vision to decision-making

The Advisor Vision was designed to be used, not admired.

It provided a practical framework for evaluating initiatives, guiding platform investment, and aligning work across portfolios. Teams could assess whether their efforts moved the organisation closer to the vision, and leadership had a clearer basis for prioritisation and sequencing.

By connecting experience outcomes to business strategy and platform design considerations, the vision helped bridge gaps between product, technology, and leadership — supporting more coordinated, enterprise-level decision-making.

Rather than prescribing a single solution, it established a shared direction that could evolve as systems and constraints changed.

## Conclusion

The work helped Northwestern Mutual move from fragmented optimisation toward a more holistic view of its digital ecosystem.

It aligned leaders and teams around a coherent experience strategy, created shared language for discussing complexity, and set the foundation for platform consolidation and modernisation efforts. Most importantly, it reframed the advisor experience as a system to be intentionally designed — not a byproduct of organisational structure.

This work sat at the intersection of vision and reality. It required operating comfortably at enterprise scale, translating complexity into clarity, and grounding future thinking in the practical constraints of today's platforms and business priorities. The Advisor Vision wasn't about predicting the future — it was about giving the organisation a clear direction it could move toward, together.
